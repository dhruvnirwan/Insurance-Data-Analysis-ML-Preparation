# Insurance Data Analysis & ML Preparation

This project explores the **Insurance dataset**, performing detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **preparing the dataset for machine learning models**.  
> **Note:** This notebook currently covers **data preparation only**; model training and evaluation will be added in future updates.

---

## Project Structure

- **insurance.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing EDA and ML preparation steps.
- **insurance.csv**: Dataset used for analysis.

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the dataset using pandas.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored data structure, missing values, and summary statistics.
- Visualized relationships between features (e.g., charges vs smoking, BMI vs age).
- Checked feature correlations.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., smoker, sex, region).
- Created new binary features (`is_smoker`, `is_female`).
- Normalized and cleaned data for modeling.

### 4. Machine Learning Preparation
- Selected features and target variable (`charges`).
- Split data into **training and testing sets**.
- Prepared dataset for regression modeling (not included yet).
